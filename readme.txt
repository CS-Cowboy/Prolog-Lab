CSCI-305 Prolog Lab addendum:

The goal of this lab was to use the meta language ML to answer a set of questions provided by the professor (Isaac). I've provided my solutions, the code I wrote is in the file "prolog-lab.ml". The dataset we used is here: http://ftp.aset.psu.edu/~saw/royal/

I took this class in the spring of 2018.
